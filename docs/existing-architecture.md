# Existing Architecture Analysis

## Authentication System

The saas-starter project likely uses one of the following authentication systems:

1. **NextAuth.js** - A popular authentication solution for Next.js applications
   - Handles OAuth providers, email/password, and JWT-based sessions
   - Stored in `/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js` or `/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js`

2. **Clerk** - Another common auth provider in modern Next.js applications
   - Provides ready-to-use components and hooks
   - Configuration in `middleware.ts` and environment variables

3. **Supabase Auth** - If using Supabase as the database
   - Handles authentication through Supabase client
   - Configuration in environment variables

## Database Models

The starter likely uses one of these database setups:

1. **Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL**
   - Schema defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`
   - Client access through `lib/prisma.ts` or similar

2. **Supabase**
   - PostgreSQL database accessed through Supabase client
   - Tables defined through Supabase interface or migration files

3. **MongoDB**
   - Schemas likely defined in `models/` directory
   - Connected through Mongoose or similar ORM

## Adaptation Strategy

For our AWS integration:

1. **Auth Adaptation**:
   - Create adapter between existing auth and AWS Cognito
   - Preserve user experience while changing backend provider

2. **Database Adaptation**:
   - Create data access layer that can work with both PostgreSQL and DynamoDB
   - Use repository pattern to abstract database operations

3. **API Routes**:
   - Extend existing API routes to integrate with AWS services
   - Create new routes for AWS-specific functionality

This document will be updated as we discover more details about the specific implementation in our starter project.
